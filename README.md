Two Processes, Parent &amp; Child with .txt file(>1000 lines)

The project contains 2 main processes, parent and child, as requested in the statement. The parent process creates N+2 semaphores and a shared memory section, which contains the line being sent, the requests, as well as some extra information used to properly synchronize the processes. Each process makes some prints to stdout/stderr for smoother control of the programs operation, but a better control is done by the log files that are printed according to the requirements of the utterance as well.
The user is prompted to launch the parent process, as in the example run below. The input file is required to have the same line size (with a maximum length of MAX_LINE_SIZE), because I preferred to use fseek for faster access to any point in the file I want. All requirements of the utterance are satisfied and the execution was tested with various input values. It was also checked for memory leaks without finding any of them.
